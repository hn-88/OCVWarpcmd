# OCVWarpcmd
Commandline only version of OCVWarp. Main repository is [OCVWarp](https://github.com/hn-88/OCVWarp).

This version does not bring up a file-open dialog, and does not preview the video in a window. The input filename is hard-coded to input.mp4 

This basic version was a temporary fix for appveyor builds not running on Windows.
